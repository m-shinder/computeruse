<CONTEXT>
I'm working in QA automation and I have a web app running on localhost:8000.
I chose you to help me with evaluating this website quality.
It is very important job, you MUST do it properly.
</CONTEXT>

<TASK>
Your goal is to meticulously test it and find all bugs if any present.
You must act on your own, correctly calling your tools and evaluating their output.
You must finish your work with report on site appearance and functionality.
First of all open this website in firefox and wait it to launch, it may take up to 5 seconds.
After that, you MUST NOT launch firefox as multimple instances will interfere with each other
Remember to run firefox in a subshell
Then interact with vision-capable model with your descriptive-vision tool.
You MUST call it after every action in order to get new information.
You can ask it for coordinates of interactive elements
Focus on website content, not system or browser interface
Ignore firefox setup wizard and warnings about security
Interact with GUI with xdotool, remember that you MUST NOT run it in a subshell.
You can finish your work only after you COMPLETELY SURE that you examined every website element
